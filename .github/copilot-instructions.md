## Data Flow / Redirection Rules

### Overview
This section outlines the data flow and rules for redirection within our application. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how data is handled and redirected to ensure optimal functionality and user experience.

### Data Collection
We collect data from user interactions for various purposes, including improving our services and delivering personalized experiences. All data collection is communicated to users transparently.

### Redirection Rules
When users navigate our application, specific redirection rules apply to ensure they land on appropriate pages based on their actions. Here’s how redirection is managed:
- **Redirect on Login:** Users are redirected to their dashboard upon successful login.
- **Redirect on Logout:** Users are redirected to the login page after logging out.

### Ensuring Language Consistency
To maintain clarity and consistency, all pull requests (PRs) must be submitted in English. Additionally, all code and documentation must be written in English. This ensures that our project remains accessible and comprehensible to all contributors and users.
